The python script main.py is placed under the src folder. The script is built on python3.


Navigate to project/repo folder and execute run.sh to compile and run the program and the output files will appear in output folder.
The python script read input file from the input folder.


main.py calculates the running median and total sum and stores the output in files in output directory.


Assumptions :

I am assuming that the transaction amount will always be greater than .50 USD , if a record with amount less than .50 USD occurs than for that record 0 usd will be displayed for total sum and that record will be counted in number of transactions, the record will not be ignored.

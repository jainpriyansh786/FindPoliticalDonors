The python script main.py is placed under the src folder.


When running the shell script run.sh the argument for output directory path should be ./output/


main.py calculates the running median and total sum and stores the output in files in output directory.
Assumptions :

I am assuming that the transaction amount will always be greater than .50 USD , if a record with amount less than .50 USD occurs than for that record 0 usd will be displayed for total sum and that record will be counted in number of transactions, the record will not be ignored.
